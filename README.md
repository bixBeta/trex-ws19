TREx Analysis Workshop Source Codes and Tutorials. 

1. Create a new directory inside of workdir on your workstation using the following command: <br>
``` mkdir /workdir/NetId``` (replace the NetId with your cornell net id) <br>

2. Change your path to the newly created directory by using the following command:<br>
``` cd /workdir/NetId ``` (replace the NetId with your cornell net id) <br>

3. Clone the github repository into your workstation using the following command: 
```git clone https://github.com/bixBeta/trex-ws19.git``` <br>
This will download a folder named trex-ws19 which contains all of the scripts that  will be used throughout the workshop.<br>

### Download Fastq Files 

In your parent workdir i.e. `/workdir/NetId`, create a new folder named `fastqs` by typing ` mkdir fastqs` and hitting return.

Change your directory to `fastqs` folder  by typing `cd fastqs` and hitting return. <br>

At any point, feel free to use the `pwd` command to check the current path of your directory. Use the `cd` command to navigate into a child folder or a parent folder. <br>

To navigate to a child folder, simply type `cd` followed by the name of the folder. <br>

To navigate to the parent folder type `cd ..` <br>
`..` has a special meaning in bash and this will tell the interpreter that the user is refering to a parent folder. <br>

Copy the download script from the cloned github repository into your current directory.
